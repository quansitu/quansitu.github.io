I am now a post-doc in [Universit√© Clermont Auvergne](https://lmbp.uca.fr). My research interest is Geometric Representation Theory, which involves studying representation theory through the tools from algebraic geoemtry and from categorification. I am specifically interested in modular representation throy of objects from Lie theory (including Lie algebras, reductive groups, Coxeter groups and their quantizations). 

I was graduated from Tsinghua University, under the supervision of Professor [Peng Shan](https://ymsc.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/info/1031/2374.htm). 

Here is my [CV](/images/CV(Quan Situ).pdf).
