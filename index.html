  I am now a post-doc in <a href="https://lmbp.uca.fr">Université Clermont Auvergne</a>. 
  My research interest is Geometric Representation Theory, which involves studying representation theory through the tools from algebraic geoemtry and from categorification. 
  I am specifically interested in modular representation throy of objects from Lie theory (including Lie algebras, reductive groups, Coxeter groups and their quantizations).

I was graduated from Tsinghua University, under the supervision of Professor <a href="https://ymsc.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/info/1031/2374.htm">Peng Shan</a>.
